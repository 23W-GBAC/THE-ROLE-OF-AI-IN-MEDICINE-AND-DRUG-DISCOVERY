# How pull request helps to make the communication esier
  

Pull requests streamline communication in software development by providing a structured platform for discussing and reviewing code changes. Firstly, they serve as a centralized hub where team members can propose modifications, comment on specific lines of code, and discuss implementation details. This eliminates the need for scattered communication channels and keeps all relevant discussions within the context of the code being modified.

Additionally, pull requests document the rationale behind each change, making it easier for team members to understand the purpose and context of the modifications. This documentation aids in onboarding new team members and ensures that everyone is aligned with the project's goals and standards.

Pull requests also facilitate code reviews, allowing team members to provide feedback, suggest improvements, and identify potential issues before the changes are merged into the main codebase. By enabling asynchronous communication and collaboration, pull requests enhance team efficiency and help maintain code quality throughout the development process.
